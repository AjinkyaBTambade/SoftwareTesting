# Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

## Introduction
Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a series of steps and activities performed during the testing process to ensure the quality and reliability of software products.

## Purpose
The purpose of STLC is to provide a systematic approach to testing software, ensuring that defects are identified and corrected before the software is released to the end-users.

## Phases of STLC

### 1. Requirement Analysis
- Understand the requirements and expectations of the software.
- Analyze requirements to determine testable features and functionalities.

### 2. Test Planning
- Develop a comprehensive test plan outlining testing objectives, scope, resources, and schedule.
- Define test strategy, test scenarios, and entry/exit criteria.

### 3. Test Case Development
- Create detailed test cases based on requirements and test scenarios.
- Test cases should cover both positive and negative scenarios.

### 4. Test Environment Setup
- Prepare the test environment with necessary hardware and software configurations.
- Install and configure testing tools required for test execution and reporting.

### 5. Test Execution
- Execute test cases according to the test plan.
- Log defects and issues found during testing.
- Monitor and track testing progress.

### 6. Defect Tracking and Management
- Log defects in a defect tracking system.
- Prioritize and assign defects to development teams for resolution.
- Verify fixes and close defects once resolved.

### 7. Test Reporting
- Generate test reports to communicate testing progress, test coverage, and defect metrics.
- Provide stakeholders with insights into the quality of the software.

### 8. Test Closure
- Evaluate the completion criteria defined in the test plan.
- Conduct a test closure meeting to review testing activities and outcomes.
- Document lessons learned and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
STLC provides a structured approach to software testing, ensuring thorough testing coverage and delivering high-quality software products to customers.
